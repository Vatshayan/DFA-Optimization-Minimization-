# DFA-Optimization-Minimization-
DFA minimization stands for converting a given DFA to its equivalent DFA with minimum number of states.
DFA State Minimization or Optimization C Program â€“  C program for DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) state minimization
This program will run in any IDE especially Turbo C++ and Codeblocks.
